## Challenges and Learnings

This project highlighted the difference between theoretical correctness and
practical reliability.

Small deviations in resistor values caused noticeable changes in output
current. Thermal effects became visible during long-duration testing.
Switching noise required careful filtering and layout awareness.

Unlike software, mistakes could not be fixed instantly. Each change required
physical modification and retesting, reinforcing the importance of planning,
measurement, and patience.

The most important lesson was that engineering is a process of controlled
compromises rather than perfect solutions.
