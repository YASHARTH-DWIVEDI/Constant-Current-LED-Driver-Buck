## Key Design Calculations

### LED Current
Target LED current was selected based on LED rating and thermal considerations.

### Sense Resistor
The sense resistor value was calculated using:
I_LED = V_sense / R_sense

Practical measurements showed deviation due to resistor tolerance and heating.

### Inductor Selection
Inductor value was chosen to limit ripple current while maintaining continuous
conduction mode under nominal operating conditions.

### Observations
Calculated values served as a starting point. Final performance depended
significantly on component tolerance and layout quality.
