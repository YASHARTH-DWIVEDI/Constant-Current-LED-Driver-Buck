## Schematic Description

The circuit consists of:
- DC input source
- N-channel MOSFET used as a high-frequency switch
- Inductor for current smoothing
- Freewheeling diode for current continuity
- Output capacitor for ripple reduction
- Low-value sense resistor for current feedback

The feedback signal is used to regulate the switching duty cycle, ensuring
constant LED current.
